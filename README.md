# responsive-design

This project was to practice builing a layout using HTML and CSS to be very responsive. This page doesn't use any javascript and makes a lot of use of media queries and flexbox.

This was an interesting project and fun because so many of the elements shift around, disappear, and reorder their information.

This project was taken from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-responsive-design)
